	<h1>Add Yourself to the Friend Queue</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this page is for verified friends to be 
	able to add themslves to the friends queue. Verification merely 
	means that you have gone to enough trainings and we think you are 
	ready to talke to people in delicate situations.</p>
	<p>You can add yourself as many times as you want, though be 
	aware that the number of times you add yourself to the list 
	is the number of people you are willing to help.</p>
	<p>At any point, you are able to go to the remove page and 
	remove all instances of your name from the queue. This lets 
	us know that you are too busy to be able to help at the moment.</p>
	<p>However, at any point you are able to re-add yourself on 
	this page again.</p>
	<p>If you notice anything wrong on this or any 
	other pages of the interface please let us know in #webdev 
	on slack or bring it up at the next meeting.</p>
	<p>HAPPY BUTTONING</p>

	the remove will be a big blue button, this is all non-negotiable.>
